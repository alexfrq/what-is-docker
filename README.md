# What is Docker?

The purpose of this repository is to supplement the video with code, and to provide a simple starting point for learning about Docker containers.

The “What is Docker” video discusses what is Docker and demonstrates how to build and run a simple Dockerfile.

The video uses Docker

'''
docker build .
